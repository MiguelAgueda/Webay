# Webay

## Setup

### Backend

clone WebayBackendAPI into root folder

from `WebayBackendAPI/` execute `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Frontend

from `frontend/` execute `npm install`

then, execute `npm run build` to build output files.

## Running the Program

From the root folder, execute `python3 WebayBackendAPI/main.py`

# Project Proposal

## Introduction

### Project Description: 
Webay is an open-source webstore backend. Currently, developers can access functions for adding/modifying/deleting listings, sorting listings based on price, as well as searching through listing titles for specific items. Other segments such as a forum and webpage requests are being worked on to make the finished project a website.

### Objective/Purpose:
The purpose of creating this website is to learn how to implement search algorithms in an actual use-case situation, and to create a completed webstore to further understanding of web development.

## Background/Related studies

### Background knowledge that led to inspiration:
One of the members of our group was keen on building a functional webstore. We decided to use this project's deadline as motivation to both start and finish this project in a timely manner.

### Summaries and notes from your sources (e.g., research papers):

## Methods

### Your implementation plan (e.g., using open-source libraries or algorithms that you've found from research articles):
Our project will be implemented using Vuejs for the front end and Python standard libraries along with the web library Flask for the backend. We also plan to use the Python standard library Clink for foreign functions in C++ and use its standard libraries. We will also use online articles about sort algorithms and best practices.

### What other sources would be available (e.g., Github, StackOverflow, etc):
Official Python Docs, Official Python Flask Docs, Official JavaScript Docs, Official Vuejs Docs, Official C++ Docs, Github, StackOverflow, YouTube, Learn Python the Hard Way (3rd, Zed Shaw)

## Discussion

### Potential Challenges that you expect to see:
We expect to face challenges in implementing web server requests to a database backend. We also expect challenges maintaining data integrity of the large amounts of listing and user information.

### What you expect to learn from this project:
We expect to learn how to implement web requests to a server. We also expect to learn how to implement better search algorithms now that we understand how to create one from the mini project.
